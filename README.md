Job Portal System - KayodNow

The aim of this project is to connect job seekers and employers through a convenient online job portal. It helps solve the problem many people have when trying to find the right job, especially in places where some people can't easily find a job or list a job. And also, some businesses can connect with people or applicants faster than the traditional method.
Our system will offer user friendly features such as login, registration, listing, and post job. Users or employers will have a dashboard that can be used to post jobs and connect with people. For job seekers, they can search for jobs based on their choices. This portal will be mobile-friendly to make sure that people using smartphones can access it easily.
